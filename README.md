<h1>Dualing Drivers</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p></p>Dualing Drivers is a local player-versus-player tank combat game developed in MonoGame, where two players battle on the same device with the goal of eliminating their opponent first. The game features multiple preset levels as well as a built-in level editor that allows players to design and play custom maps. Gameplay is enhanced through strategically placed power-ups that grant temporary advantages, and a tile-based environment system that includes pass-through tiles, breakable terrain, and solid obstacles that affect both movement and projectile behavior.</p>
<p>My contributions focused on the tile system and power-up mechanics, including implementing tile interactions (breakable, pass-through, and solid tiles), collision behavior, and power-up pickup and effect logic.</p>
